# CPU backend

## Outcome and status

This guide defines the CPU integration boundary and helps contributors avoid treating CPU routes
as separate backends. The current CPU module implements a truthful fail-closed capability
provider, run-owned aligned native buffer/workspace representations, exact borrowed-segment cold
binding, a direct prepared-invocation seam, bounded worker infrastructure, and a backend-private
Java 26 generated-kernel foundation. It advertises and executes no Model operation yet.

The lower-level OpenBLAS provider separately implements explicit library loading, required-symbol
binding, a caller-owned lookup lifetime, low-level FLOAT32/FLOAT64 dense row-major general matrix
multiplication (GEMM), and direct positive thread-count query/control. Those leaf capabilities do
not make OpenBLAS a CPU route until a later CPU prepare task supplies truthful eligibility,
normalization, fallback, and executable integration.

## Prerequisites and terms

Contributors need JDK 26 and the ownership rules in the [architecture
contract](../../ARCHITECTURE.md#cpu-backend-routes). Real loading also requires a compatible
OpenBLAS binary already installed or otherwise available to the operating-system loader, plus
deployment JVM permission for restricted native access.

- A **route** is one backend-local implementation choice. The glossary entry for
  [backend route](../glossary.md#backend-route) explains why OpenBLAS is not a separate backend.
- The **Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API** is the JDK native-interoperability API used to
  load the library and bind C symbols.
- An [OpenBLAS library handle](../glossary.md#openblas-library-handle--openblaslibrary) is the
  caller-owned Java lifetime for one complete lookup and binding set. It exposes mutable native
  thread state without owning a thread-selection policy.

## Ownership mental model and scope

The CPU backend owns capability reporting and physical CPU representations. It will later own
partition lowering, specialization, fusion, scalar and optimized routes, executable units, and
typed tracing. Scalar, Vector API, generated Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode computation
kernels, specialized or fused kernels, and OpenBLAS implementations remain routes within one CPU
owner. The architecture does not require a particular bytecode-generation API.

```text
planning: owner = CPU
CPU prepare: choose scalar / Vector API / generated JVM bytecode / OpenBLAS / specialized / fused
runtime: invoke prepared CPU executable
```

The low-level OpenBLAS provider owns library loading, symbol binding, GEMM calls, and thread
control only. Dependency direction is `backends/cpu -> backends/openblas-provider`.

## Current CPU foundation

`CpuCapabilityProvider` is the only public CPU type. It returns the exact stable
`BackendId("cpu")` constant and returns `false` for every non-null operation capability query.
That identity lets Planning refer to CPU consistently; it does not assert availability,
registration, route readiness, or executable semantic coverage.

The backend-private execution package supplies two physical ownership forms:

- `CpuBorrowedBuffer` retains one exact caller-owned `HostTensorStorage` and segment. Its close is
  a no-op and it never copies, slices, reinterprets, or closes caller memory.
- `CpuNativeBuffer` and `CpuNativeWorkspace` each own one exact aligned native segment in a
  distinct shared arena. They are run-owned, accessible across permitted CPU worker/Foreign
  Function and Memory (FFM) threads while open, and close their arena at most once.

Cold binding classifies each selected buffer independently and does not materialize bytes. If an
exact primitive heap carrier is observable and matches the logical data type, the bound argument
retains that array plus the carrier-relative byte offset and exact byte size. Otherwise the
`CpuBufferArgument.Segment` form retains the exact selected `MemorySegment` or slice, reports
`byteOffset() == 0`, and preserves its byte size and read-only state. `Segment` is an access form,
not a native-provenance claim: genuine native segments use it, and so do heap-backed segments
whose exact primitive carrier is unavailable. In JDK 26, a read-only heap segment has an empty
`heapBase()`, so CPU binding keeps that exact read-only segment without copying.

Every binding checks representation kind, liveness, current-thread access, exact byte size,
writability, logical data type, carrier compatibility when observable, and required alignment.
Mixed array and exact-segment selections are ordinary ordered inputs and outputs. The later
route-specific binder receives fresh cold arrays once and must retain the needed direct typed
fields in its bound invocation. The hot call performs no representation lookup, heap-base
discovery, type switch, route selection, materialization, or allocation.

The fixed worker group owns daemon platform workers and splits a non-empty half-open range into
bounded deterministic contiguous ranges. It provides synchronous completion, isolated concurrent
submissions, cooperative cancellation between ranges, first/suppressed failure propagation,
interrupt restoration, and idempotent shutdown. It does not select an operation, kernel, route,
thread count from configuration, or reduction combine policy.

## Current generated-kernel foundation

The generated-kernel foundation turns one already-selected typed specialization and one
family-owned emitter into verified Java class bytes and a directly invocable hidden-class
artifact. It is deliberately narrower than a CPU route:

```text
typed specialization + matching family emitter
  -> deterministic Java 26 class bytes
  -> Class-File API verification
  -> fresh hidden nestmate class
  -> exact static MethodHandle entry point
```

The Java Class-File API is the current CPU-internal bytecode builder, and the Java Vector API is
the current CPU-internal vector mechanism. Both are implementation choices, not architecture
invariants. The Vector API remains an incubator module in Java 26 and is enabled only for CPU
compile, test, and Javadoc tasks.

`CpuKernelSpecialization` is an immutable, structurally comparable description of every fact that
may change emitted bytes. It contains the generator schema and Java class-file target, a
family-owned lowering fingerprint, ordered argument carrier and access facts, baked byte offsets,
element strides and extents, dynamic-extent count, execution mode, exact Vector species when
applicable, byte order, unroll/tile/tail structure, the current exact/default numerical mode, and
partial-combine ordering. A second SHA-256 content fingerprint covers that complete ordered
specialization. These fingerprints are deterministic compatibility identities, not security
authentication, Model-operation capability, or a persistent cache format.

The portable mode vocabulary has exactly four values:

| Mode | Emission form | Invocation range |
|---|---|---|
| Scalar single-thread | Scalar instructions | One complete element count |
| Scalar parallel | Scalar instructions | Caller-assigned half-open start/end plus range index |
| Vector API single-thread | Exact-species Vector API instructions | One complete element count |
| Vector API parallel | Exact-species Vector API instructions | Caller-assigned half-open start/end plus range index |

The mode owns only the structural choice between the scalar and Vector family callback. A family
emitter owns semantic instruction construction, while distinct carrier, scalar, Vector, range/
tile/tail, and partial/combine emitters provide low-level bytecode seams. No production family
emitter exists yet. The range controls do not create parallel work: `CpuWorkerGroup` still owns
worker dispatch, synchronization, cancellation, and failure propagation outside generated code.

Generated entry signatures use the selected primitive array carrier (`double[]`, `float[]`,
`short[]`, `int[]`, `long[]`, or `byte[]`), an exact `MemorySegment`, or an ordered mixture. A
primitive-array byte offset is either baked into the specialization or passed as a primitive
`long`; exact segments use a segment-relative zero base. Dynamic extents and the single-thread
count or parallel range controls are also primitive entry arguments. Generation performs no copy
and owns none of the supplied arrays or segments. Read-only, write-only, and read-write access
facts constrain emitted loads and stores; exact-segment liveness, thread access, size, and
writability remain cold-binding obligations.

`CpuGeneratedKernel` retains the specialization, verified bytes, full-privilege hidden lookup,
hidden class, exact static method handle, and method type. Retaining the artifact retains that
hidden-class lifetime, but the foundation promises no unloading time. Equal generation requests
produce identical bytes and distinct hidden classes and artifacts because no generated-artifact
cache exists yet; bounded reuse belongs to CPU task 0003.

Current tests invoke only bounded synthetic copy and structural probes across heap, exact-segment,
and mixed signatures in all four modes. They prove the generator and direct-carrier seams, not a
Tensor result, a prepared CPU route, numerical correctness, or Model-operation coverage.

## Current low-level OpenBLAS foundation

[`OpenBlasLibrary`](../glossary.md#openblas-library-handle--openblaslibrary) is the current public
lifetime boundary. A caller opens exactly one supplied operating-system library name or one
absolute path:

The first example proves only that the supplied library loaded, exported the complete required
symbol set, and remained open inside one caller-owned scope. It assumes that the loader resolves
the exact name `openblas` to a compatible 32-bit-`blasint` build.

```java
import io.github.pho001.synaptik.backend.provider.openblas.OpenBlasLibrary;

try (OpenBlasLibrary library = OpenBlasLibrary.open("openblas")) {
    if (!library.isOpen()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("unexpected closed OpenBLAS handle");
    }
}
```

`open("openblas")` passes that name unchanged to the JDK lookup and returns only after all four
required symbols bind. `isOpen()` then reports this owner's local lifecycle state. Exiting the
try-with-resources block closes the lookup lifetime, including when the body fails. The final
observable state is a closed Java owner; this proves loading, binding, and cleanup only, not a
GEMM result or viable CPU route.

The input is explicit: the provider does not choose a platform filename, inspect configuration,
read an environment variable or system property, search directories, or decide fallback. The
path overload requires an absolute path and passes it unchanged to the JDK lookup.

Opening succeeds only after the provider binds this complete ordered set:

1. `cblas_sgemm`;
2. `cblas_dgemm`;
3. `openblas_set_num_threads`; and
4. `openblas_get_num_threads`.

The bindings use the ordinary OpenBLAS C interface with 32-bit `blasint`. A library using the
64-bit integer interface is outside the current contract. Missing symbols fail the whole open in
the order above, the partial lookup lifetime is closed, and the caller receives
`OpenBlasLoadException` with the original failure as its cause.

Each successful open returns a fresh Java owner backed by a shared Foreign Function and Memory
(FFM) arena. `close()` is safe for repeated or concurrent close attempts and ends that owner's
lookup lifetime. It does not promise physical unloading, because the JDK, operating system, or
another owner may retain the same process library. A later native call must not race closure.

The handle exposes no native address or Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) handle. It now exposes
`sgemm` and `dgemm` for one already-normalized product:

```text
C[m,n] = alpha * (A[m,k] x B[k,n]) + beta * C[m,n]
```

`A`, `B`, and `C` begin at byte offset zero in caller-owned native segments. They use dense
row-major, non-transposed geometry; `A` and `B` may be read-only, while `C` must be writable and
must not overlap either required input range. The provider validates dimensions, segment
lifetime/access, alignment, required spans, and overlap before it either calls OpenBLAS or returns
for an output-empty product. It forwards scalar bits unchanged and does not define OpenBLAS
numerical accuracy, exceptional-value, determinism, or performance behavior.

A positive-output call with `k == 0` still invokes OpenBLAS so `beta` can apply to `C`. Calls with
`m == 0 || n == 0` make no native call only after complete validation. Caller memory remains
borrowed for the call: the provider does not allocate, copy, retain, reinterpret, or close it.
Concurrent calls require caller-managed nonconflicting segment access, and callers must not race
`close()` with invocation.

This is an invocation boundary, not a CPU route. A later CPU prepare implementation must still
decide whether OpenBLAS is eligible, normalize MATMUL and higher-level operations into this exact
geometry, materialize transpose or layout conversions, pack when required, allocate and bind storage,
construct prepared execution, choose and safely coordinate threads, and provide scalar or other
fallback. Direct provider thread control does not perform any of those CPU decisions.

### Direct thread control

`threadCount()` returns the exact positive count reported by OpenBLAS. `setThreadCount(int)`
accepts a positive 32-bit count and returns after the native setter invocation completes; it does
not confirm an effective later value. Synaptik conservatively treats the setting as mutable
library/process state. Two owners of one loaded binary may observe one another's mutations, but
the provider makes no shared-state claim across independently loaded copies, loader namespaces,
or arbitrary native consumers.

The following pattern shows caller-owned temporary restoration. It assumes the caller has already
excluded concurrent OpenBLAS work and writers for the complete scope:

```java
try (OpenBlasLibrary library = OpenBlasLibrary.open("openblas")) {
    int original = library.threadCount();
    try {
        library.setThreadCount(1);
        // Perform coordinated OpenBLAS work while the requested count is installed.
    } finally {
        library.setThreadCount(original);
    }
}
```

The intermediate requested value is `1`; the final requested value is the captured positive
`original` count. This pattern proves only explicit caller coordination and restoration attempts.
A competing native writer can still change the value, query/set sequences are not atomic,
concurrent setters have no provider-defined winner, and thread mutation is not serialized with
GEMM. The owner must remain open through restoration, and `close()` neither restores the count nor
safely races a query, setter, or GEMM call.

### Low-level invocation example

This example supplies one `A[2,4] x B[4,3] -> C[2,3]` geometry. It requires the same compatible
installed library and native-access permission as the loading example; it demonstrates the Java
contract and call boundary, not numerical correctness.

```java
import io.github.pho001.synaptik.backend.provider.openblas.OpenBlasLibrary;
import java.lang.foreign.Arena;
import java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment;

try (Arena matrices = Arena.ofConfined();
        OpenBlasLibrary library = OpenBlasLibrary.open("openblas")) {
    MemorySegment a = matrices.allocate(2L * 4L * Float.BYTES, Float.BYTES);
    MemorySegment b = matrices.allocate(4L * 3L * Float.BYTES, Float.BYTES);
    MemorySegment c = matrices.allocate(2L * 3L * Float.BYTES, Float.BYTES);

    library.sgemm(2, 3, 4, 1.0f, a, b, 0.0f, c);
}
```

The three allocations provide 32, 48, and 24 bytes respectively: exactly the dense row-major
ranges for 8, 12, and 6 FLOAT32 elements. The call requests `alpha = 1` and `beta = 0`; the
provider checks the open owner and all matrix preconditions, derives leading dimensions 4, 3,
and 3, then invokes the bound SGEMM symbol. Normal return means that validation and native
invocation completed without a reported failure. It does not establish particular values in
`c`, because installed-library numerical validation belongs to the provider checkpoint.

## Typical mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| Loading fails immediately for a short name | The operating-system loader cannot resolve the exact supplied name. | Supply an installed name the loader recognizes or use the absolute-path overload. |
| Opening reports missing required symbols | The selected binary is incompatible or incomplete for the four-symbol contract. | Supply a compatible OpenBLAS C library; do not treat a partial binding as available. |
| A caller expects scalar fallback after `OpenBlasLoadException` | Fallback policy was placed mentally in the leaf provider. | Handle policy in later CPU/composition code; the provider only reports loading failure. |
| A caller passes batched, transposed, strided, offset, or tensor-shaped data directly to `sgemm`/`dgemm` | The low-level call was mistaken for CPU normalization. | Normalize and materialize the exact dense row-major product in future CPU prepare/execution code. |
| A caller expects the provider to allocate or return `C` | The borrowed in-place ABI boundary was mistaken for a storage API. | Supply a writable, sufficiently large native `C` segment and retain its ownership. |
| Two Java handles appear to have independent thread counts | Both may refer to the same loaded binary and mutable library/process state. | Conservatively coordinate their thread mutations together; do not infer sharing across independent copies or namespaces. |
| A temporary thread setting remains after the Java owner closes | The provider owns only local lookup lifetime and does not retain or restore a prior value. | Capture a positive count, exclude competing native work, and restore explicitly through a still-open owner. |

## Toolchain and resources

The project baseline is JDK 26. The Vector API remains an incubator module and is not enabled
globally; a focused CPU task must configure and validate it. Real OpenBLAS loading requires a
compatible installed library and deployment JVM permission for restricted native access. The
ordinary provider unit tests do not require an installed OpenBLAS library.

## Native checkpoint and validation

The test-source `OpenBlasNativeCheckpoint` accepts exactly one caller-supplied absolute compatible-
library path. In an isolated process with native access explicitly enabled, it opens that path
twice, requests count `1`, checks observation through both owners, runs one fixed SGEMM and DGEMM
case, and restores and verifies the captured count in `finally`. It performs no discovery,
download, packaging, fallback, or environment/property lookup.

The ordinary provider suite passed 5 suites and 50 tests with no skips, failures, or errors using
deterministic fake handles. The isolated real-native checkpoint subsequently passed against the
supplied compatible arm64 OpenBLAS 0.3.33 library, including shared thread-count observation,
fixed SGEMM/DGEMM cases, and restoration of the original thread count. The ordered repository and
architecture capability checkpoint then passed, and the provider milestone is complete.

The current CPU foundation adds fail-closed capability, storage/binding/worker infrastructure,
and synthetic generated-kernel machinery only. No CPU operation capability, normalization, route
threshold, Model-operation execution path, fallback, backend conformance, or performance result
is implemented or promised. Ordinary provider tests
prove Java validation and exact ABI forwarding, not installed-library numerical correctness. The
native checkpoint proves only its selected binary and fixed cases.
Future CPU work must compare optimized routes with a scalar reference through backend-conformance
tests and keep benchmarks reproducible.
