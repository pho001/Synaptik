# Current architecture documentation

This document is the navigation page for explanations of the current Synaptik architecture.

The authoritative architecture contract is:

- [`../../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)

This file and the other documents in this directory are explanatory documentation. They do not replace the contract or report implementation completion.

Focused architecture documentation:

- [Overview](overview.md)
- [Lifecycle](lifecycle.md)
- [Module boundaries](module-boundaries.md)
- [Dependency rules](dependency-rules.md)
- [Partition scoring](partition-scoring.md)
- [Performance evidence and model autotuning](performance-evidence-and-tuning.md)
- [Training graph](training-graph.md)
- [ADR 0009: Compiler-owned pre-capture Tensor-expression autograd](../design/decisions/0009-compiler-owned-pre-capture-tensor-expression-autograd.md)
- [ADR 0007: Neural-network module and training boundary](../design/decisions/0007-neural-network-module-and-training-boundary.md)
- [Tracing](tracing.md)
- [Runtime / Prepare / Backend boundary](runtime-prepare-backend-boundary.md)
- [ADR 0010: Staged backend preparation](../design/decisions/0010-staged-backend-preparation.md)

## Status

This index is current. The architecture describes the intended complete system, while the repository currently implements only the initial model foundations. The [implementation roadmap](../planning/roadmap.md) is the source for delivery status.

## Decisions and strategies

- [Architecture decision records and design notes](../design/README.md)
- [Backend integration guides](../index.md#documentation-areas)
- [Developer guides](../index.md#documentation-areas)
