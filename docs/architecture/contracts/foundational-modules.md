# Foundational module contract

> This scoped contract is incorporated by the [authoritative architecture root](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md).
> It is normative only within the scope stated below and has no independent authority. Root global
> invariants and dependency rules apply everywhere and take precedence. Any overlap, contradiction,
> missing applicable scope, or ambiguity requires an explicit architecture update; do not choose

## Scope

This contract owns the detailed responsibilities and prohibitions for Trace, Backend Contract,
Model, Config, and Planning. Its Planning scope is the module boundary and ownership question;
the detailed partition-scoring algorithm boundary belongs to the compiler/autograd contract. This
file does not own recurrent-scan semantics, compiler behavior, execution lifecycles, concrete
backends, or extensions.

## Module responsibilities

### `modules/trace`

`modules/trace` owns typed diagnostic DTOs only.

Allowed:

- trace event envelopes
- typed compile payloads
- typed prepare payloads
- typed run payloads
- typed backend payloads
- trace-local IDs
- typed trace attributes

Forbidden:

- importing model
- importing planning
- importing compiler
- importing runtime
- importing prepare
- importing engine
- importing concrete backends
- graph traversal
- backend execution
- business logic
- runtime state

Trace must use typed DTOs.

`Map<String,String>` must not be used as the primary trace model.

Backend-specific details may use typed `TraceAttributes` as an escape hatch.

### `modules/backend-contract`

`modules/backend-contract` owns minimal backend identities and declarative requirements.

Allowed:

- `BackendId`
- `BackendDeviceId`
- `BackendAvailabilitySnapshot`
- `BackendRequirement`
- `DeviceClass`

Forbidden:

- kernel registry
- operation support logic
- backend prepare services
- executable units
- runtime storage
- physical buffers
- cost model implementation

Compile-time plans must hold backend identity, not live backend services.

Use `BackendId`, not concrete backend objects, in compile-time ownership and partitioning data.

### `modules/model`

`modules/model` owns the public tensor model, operation semantics, shape/data type/layout model, host storage abstraction, and immutable graph model.

Allowed:

- `Tensor`
- `TensorId`
- `TensorFactory`
- `DataType`
- `Shape`
- `LayoutDescriptor`
- `HostTensorStorage`
- `MemorySegmentStorage`
- `Operation`
- `OperationAttrs`
- `CompiledGraphModel`
- `CompiledNode`
- `GraphValue`
- `NodeId`
- `ValueId`
- `GraphPhase`
- `ForwardPublicationBinding`
- `TensorDescriptor`

Forbidden:

- backend support
- `supportedBackends()`
- device residency
- runtime workspaces
- physical device buffers
- kernel selection
- backend-specific storage
- prepared execution
- runtime state

`Tensor` may retain its existing mutable borrowed host-storage association, but it must not own
gradient state or runtime device residency. Its identity, descriptor, and expression provenance
remain immutable.

Every derived expression producer owns one operation occurrence, its ordered input tensors, its
ordered output descriptors, and the canonical exact `Tensor` wrapper for every output slot.
`TensorFactory` constructs those wrappers atomically with their indexed provenance. A producer
must return the retained wrapper for a slot rather than reconstructing an equal wrapper. This
pre-capture model relationship is not graph IR, graph membership, or graph-local identity.

Device storage belongs to runtime/backend layers, not model.

### `modules/config`

`modules/config` owns declarative configuration only.

Allowed:

- `CompileConfig`
- `CompileMode`
- `BackendIntent`
- `GraphOptimizationConfig`
- `PartitionScoringConfig`
- `PartitionScoringPolicy`
- `PrepareConfig`
- `CpuPrepareConfig`
- `AcceleratorPrepareConfig`
- `RunOptions`
- `PublicationPolicy`
- immutable declarative planning-cost inputs, after their planning consumer is stable
- immutable declarative model-autotuning inputs, after their owning contracts are stable

Forbidden:

- live services
- concrete backend classes
- kernel class references
- runtime state
- executable units
- backend-specific implementation logic
- benchmark runners, model-autotuning search, cache mutation, or measurement algorithms
- live platform discovery or mutable measurement evidence

Backend-specific interpretation of config belongs to backend prepare.

### `modules/planning`

`modules/planning` owns backend-neutral compile-time planning.

Allowed:

- backend intent propagation
- capability query contracts
- capability matrix construction
- backend-neutral partition scoring
- node ownership decisions
- segment ownership decisions
- maximal same-owner partitioning
- logical materialization requirements
- logical memory requirements
- backend-neutral planning cost estimates and profiles

Forbidden:

- fusion implementation
- specialization
- concrete kernel selection
- OpenBLAS route selection
- Vector API route selection
- MPSGraph route selection
- CUDA kernel selection
- physical memory allocation
- runtime residency
- prepared schedules
- prepared executables
- backend-specific DAG construction
- backend-specific lowering
- runtime execution units
- concrete kernel/runtime scoring
- backend route names or route-selection parameters
- vector species, lane counts, unroll factors, thread counts, chunk sizes, or tile sizes

Planning answers:

```text
Where should this node or segment run?
```

Planning must not answer:

```text
Which concrete kernel, executable, BLAS route, MPSGraph route, or CUDA implementation should run it?
```
