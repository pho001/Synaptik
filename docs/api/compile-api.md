# Compile API

## Purpose and implementation status

This reference separates the compile-time model values implemented today from the compiler and
engine APIs that remain planned. The repository does not yet provide a runnable graph compiler.

Compilation will answer two questions: what the computation means, and which backend identity owns
each planned region. It will not create physical buffers, choose concrete kernels, or construct
prepared executables.

## Current model contracts

The `io.github.pho001.synaptik.model.graph` package now provides compiler-neutral data that later
compiler work can produce and consume:

| Current contract | Meaning | Deliberate boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `CompiledGraphModel` | Immutable ordered graph values, topological nodes, declared input/output boundaries, and exact node phases | Structural graph state, not compiler passes, partitions, storage, or execution |
| `GraphPhase` | Exactly `FORWARD` or `BACKWARD` compile-time node classification | Not a compile mode, optimizer phase, or runtime schedule |
| `PublicationBinding` | Standalone `TensorId`-to-`ValueId` association | Not an owning publication plan and not a `CompiledGraphModel` component |

`CompiledGraphModel` validates structural closure when constructed. It snapshots its lists and
phase map, requires resolvable references and topological node order, enforces producer and phase
coverage rules, and stores no derived indexes. This validation does not capture an expression,
infer descriptors, transform a graph, perform autograd, plan backend ownership, or make the model
executable.

A `PublicationBinding` carries only two identities. A later compiler-owned `PublicationPlan` will
group bindings with their owning compilation context and publication policy. The binding itself
does not retain a public `Tensor`, gradient role, runtime target, storage, backend, or execution
state.

The public `Tensor` model is also current. Its `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `min`, `max`, and
tensor-valued `pow` methods construct storage-free floating binary expressions with immutable
operation-and-ordered-input provenance. That origin metadata gives a future compiler an expression
to traverse, but no current API captures it into `CompiledGraphModel`, performs inference or
optimization, or produces compile artifacts.

## Current expression input and planned compiler output

Conceptually, compilation will receive a requested tensor output and declarative `CompileConfig`:

```java
// Conceptual API; not currently runnable.
CompiledGraph graph = CompiledGraph.compile(output, CompileConfig.auto());
```

- `output` will identify a current public `Tensor` expression for the future compiler to capture.
  Public Tensor state and binary expression construction are implemented; the compiler entry
  point, traversal, capture, and conversion into graph values and nodes remain planned.
- `CompileConfig` will describe compile mode, backend intent, optimization, scoring, and
  publication policy as data. It will not contain live backend services.
- `PublicationPlan` will be compiler-owned context around publication bindings. It is planned and
  is separate from the current model graph.
- `CompileArtifacts` will combine a `CompiledGraphModel`, planned partitions, a logical memory
  plan, a `PublicationPlan`, and diagnostics. It is planned and will remain non-executable.
- `CompiledGraph` will be an engine facade over immutable `CompileArtifacts`, not the same object
  as the current `CompiledGraphModel`.

The planned artifacts deliberately contain no device buffers, backend executable objects, runtime
residency, prepared schedules, or mutable run state.

## Planned lifecycle and failures

```text
expression -> capture -> inference and validation -> optimization
           -> optional autograd -> backend ownership -> logical plans
           -> CompileArtifacts
```

Compilation is expected to reject invalid shapes, data types, operations, graph structure, or
unsatisfied backend capabilities before preparation. Exact exception types and callable signatures
remain to be specified by compiler and engine tasks; callers must not code against invented
exceptions from this conceptual page.

## Example interpretation

If a future graph contains a matrix multiplication followed by a small elementwise operation,
capability analysis may find both CPU and Metal valid. Backend-neutral scoring may assign both
nodes to Metal to avoid a transfer boundary. The artifact records only `owner = Metal`; it does
not record MPSGraph or a custom Metal kernel. Metal prepare makes that later choice.

This scenario is conceptual. The current graph DTOs can represent and structurally validate node
relationships, but they cannot run this compilation or select ownership.
