# Tensor API

This reference documents the public tensor-model contracts as they are introduced. The authoritative module boundary remains [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Data types

The initial `DataType` model contains six backend-independent element types:

| Data type | Category | Bit width | Byte width | Differentiable |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `FLOAT64` | `FLOATING` | 64 | 8 | yes |
| `FLOAT32` | `FLOATING` | 32 | 4 | yes |
| `BFLOAT16` | `FLOATING` | 16 | 2 | yes |
| `INT32` | `INTEGRAL` | 32 | 4 | no |
| `INT64` | `INTEGRAL` | 64 | 8 | no |
| `BOOL` | `BOOLEAN` | 8 | 1 | no |

`FLOAT32` is the default floating data type. Data type metadata describes logical model semantics and does not claim that a particular backend supports the type or uses the same physical allocation alignment.

### Floating promotion

Implicit promotion is defined only within the floating category:

```text
BFLOAT16 < FLOAT32 < FLOAT64
```

`DataTypePromotion.promoteFloating(left, right)` returns the widest input precision. Integral, boolean, null, and cross-category inputs are rejected. Converting between categories requires a future explicit cast operation rather than an implicit promotion rule.

### BFLOAT16 representation

`BFloat16Bits` converts scalar values between Java `float` and raw BFLOAT16 bits held in a `short`. Conversion to BFLOAT16 uses round-to-nearest with ties to even, preserves signed zero and infinities, and canonicalizes NaN to `0x7FC0`.

The utility describes the value format only. It does not allocate storage, expose device formats, or report backend capabilities.

## Shapes and dimensions

`Shape` is an immutable ordered collection of `Dimension` values. A dimension is either:

- `StaticDimension`, with a known non-negative `long` size; or
- `DynamicDimension`, with a canonical non-blank symbolic name.

Dynamic dimensions are explicit values and never use negative numeric sentinels. Shape values defensively isolate caller-owned arrays and expose immutable dimension lists.

### Scalars and empty tensors

`Shape.scalar()` is the canonical rank-0 scalar shape. It has no axes and its known element count is one.

Static size zero is valid. For example, `Shape.of(2, 0, 4)` represents an empty tensor and has a known element count of zero. Static dimensions use `long`; later storage implementations may impose narrower allocation limits without changing the logical shape.

### Static and dynamic element counts

`Shape.knownElementCount()` returns a present checked `long` value only when every dimension is static. Dynamic shapes return an empty optional. Non-zero multiplication overflow raises `ArithmeticException`; a fully static shape containing a zero dimension has count zero even when multiplying other dimensions would overflow.

`Shape.toLongArray()` copies the ordered static sizes and rejects dynamic shapes. Positive and negative axes are normalized through the shape, while every axis is invalid for a rank-0 scalar.

### Broadcasting

`ShapeBroadcast.broadcast(left, right)` applies right-aligned broadcasting. Equal dimensions are preserved and static size `1` expands to the opposing dimension. This includes scalar broadcasting and zero-sized dimensions such as `[0, 3]` with `[1, 3]`.

Equal dynamic symbols are compatible, and a singleton may expand to a dynamic dimension. Different symbols or a dynamic dimension paired with a non-singleton static size are rejected because local model code cannot prove their compatibility. Graph-wide symbolic constraints belong to future compiler shape inference.

Shape broadcasting does not calculate strides, layouts, storage, materialization, or backend execution information.

## Resolved layouts

`LayoutDescriptor` is an immutable description of resolved logical element geometry for a fully static shape. The descriptor records rank, non-negative `long` element strides, a non-negative storage offset measured in elements, explicit view/alias metadata, and the checked element span needed to contain every referenced index. It does not retain the `Shape` used to construct it.

Resolved layouts have four geometric kinds:

- `DENSE_CONTIGUOUS` uses canonical row-major strides and offset zero;
- `DENSE_WITH_OFFSET` uses canonical row-major strides and a non-zero element offset;
- `STRIDED` uses non-canonical strides without non-singleton broadcast repetition; and
- `BROADCAST_ZERO_STRIDE` repeats at least one static dimension larger than one through stride zero.

`LayoutDescriptor.contiguous(shape)` derives canonical row-major strides. `LayoutDescriptor.of(shape, strides, storageOffset, view)` validates and classifies explicit geometry. Caller-owned stride arrays are defensively copied, and `strides()` returns a new copy. Individual strides support positive and negative axis lookup.

Layout classification is independent of the explicit view flag except that broadcast zero-stride repetition must be marked as a view. A raw zero stride on a singleton or empty dimension is not itself broadcast geometry. Canonical empty layouts are classified as dense even when their canonical stride sequence contains zero.

The referenced element span is zero for any shape containing a zero-sized dimension. A rank-0 scalar references one element at its offset. All stride and span arithmetic is checked for `long` overflow.

Dynamic shapes do not yet have numeric layout descriptors because their concrete strides and span are unresolved. Symbolic layout resolution belongs to later compiler and preparation contracts. The model descriptor exposes geometry only: it does not own storage, byte addresses, device state, backend information, or a decision about whether materialization is required.

## Planned tensor contracts

Tensor values, host storage, operations, and factories will be documented here as their ordered model tasks are implemented.
