# Tensor API

This reference documents the public tensor-model contracts as they are introduced. The authoritative module boundary remains [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Data types

The initial `DataType` model contains six backend-independent element types:

| Data type | Category | Bit width | Byte width | Differentiable |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `FLOAT64` | `FLOATING` | 64 | 8 | yes |
| `FLOAT32` | `FLOATING` | 32 | 4 | yes |
| `BFLOAT16` | `FLOATING` | 16 | 2 | yes |
| `INT32` | `INTEGRAL` | 32 | 4 | no |
| `INT64` | `INTEGRAL` | 64 | 8 | no |
| `BOOL` | `BOOLEAN` | 8 | 1 | no |

`FLOAT32` is the default floating data type. Data type metadata describes logical model semantics and does not claim that a particular backend supports the type or uses the same physical allocation alignment.

### Floating promotion

Implicit promotion is defined only within the floating category:

```text
BFLOAT16 < FLOAT32 < FLOAT64
```

`DataTypePromotion.promoteFloating(left, right)` returns the widest input precision. Integral, boolean, null, and cross-category inputs are rejected. Converting between categories requires a future explicit cast operation rather than an implicit promotion rule.

### BFLOAT16 representation

`BFloat16Bits` converts scalar values between Java `float` and raw BFLOAT16 bits held in a `short`. Conversion to BFLOAT16 uses round-to-nearest with ties to even, preserves signed zero and infinities, and canonicalizes NaN to `0x7FC0`.

The utility describes the value format only. It does not allocate storage, expose device formats, or report backend capabilities.

## Planned tensor contracts

Tensor values, shapes, layouts, host storage, operations, and factories will be documented here as their ordered model tasks are implemented.
