# Training API

## Purpose and implementation status

This reference records the planned public training concepts without inventing callable APIs.
`extensions/training`, public gradient publication, optimizer behavior, and prepared execution
are not implemented. The compiler now provides a public immutable functional-gradient request
value and a bounded package-private one/two-stage reverse-mode integration path.

Training will own backend-independent optimizer algorithms and session concepts. The compiler will own global automatic differentiation (autograd), while concrete backends will own any backend-specific lowering or fused optimizer route.

The accepted compiler design builds one or two reverse-mode stages with existing public Tensor
operations before one combined forward/backward capture. Model task 0025 and Compiler tasks 0004
and 0006 are Complete.
Public Tensors gain no gradient/backward lifecycle state. The current internal `TRAINING_STEP`
mode uses the same `FunctionalGradientRequest` contract as `FORWARD_AND_BACKWARD`; it adds no
optimizer update. Runtime gradient delivery, optimizer behavior, preparation, and execution
remain planned.

Package-private `GraphCompiler` currently returns mode-neutral `GraphCompilation`. A
`TRAINING_STEP` result may carry the same combined forward/backward graph as
`FORWARD_AND_BACKWARD`; a `FORWARD_ONLY` result has no BACKWARD nodes and empty gradient results.
This internal graph-stage result is not the later `CompileArtifacts` aggregate or a training
session/result type.

The current request supports one or two bounded stages, exact forward or first-stage-gradient
output references, aligned explicit seeds or scalar default seeds, ordered identity-unique
targets, and ERROR/ZERO disconnected behavior. The compiler preflights each complete selected
slice before creating formulas, captures forward and all derivative roots once, and retains
per-node derivative order beside unchanged graph phase. These facts do not expose a public
training workflow, deliver a gradient at runtime, mutate a parameter, choose a backend, prepare a
schedule, or execute training.

## Planned concepts

- `extensions/nn` will own `Parameter` and `Buffer` declarations as module state. Training will
  consume those parameters, while `ParameterGroup` will describe optimizer-group settings.
- `Optimizer` implementations such as SGD, Adam, and AdamW will define mathematical updates without importing CPU, Metal, or CUDA modules.
- `TrainingSession` and `TrainingStep` will coordinate forward/backward execution, gradient publication, and optimizer updates through shared lifecycle contracts.

No signatures, default hyperparameters, mutation rules, serialization format, or exception types are stable yet. They will be defined by focused extension tasks after model, compiler, runtime, and publication contracts exist.

## Planned public initial flow

```text
compile forward + backward graph
  -> prepare owned partitions
  -> run forward/backward
  -> publish gradients
  -> optimizer.step()
```

The initial optimizer step is backend-agnostic. A later architecture version may compile optimizer updates into the graph, but that direction requires the architecture update described by the contract.

## Boundary example

Adam computes moment estimates and a parameter update from gradients. That mathematical algorithm belongs to training. Choosing a fused Metal kernel for the update belongs to Metal prepare. A `MetalOptimizerBridge` inside training would reverse the required dependency direction and is not a supported design.
