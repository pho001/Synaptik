**Reader model.** A descriptor is a description of a value, not its data. **Data type** says how
one element is represented, **shape** gives the axis sizes, and **layout** optionally maps
coordinates to storage positions. A **gradient** describes how changing an input affects a
selected result; `requiresGrad` requests eligibility for that calculation, not proof that the
calculation is supported. A descriptor can therefore describe `[2, 3]` FLOAT32 data without
allocating six numbers, and without yet choosing strides or an offset.

## Tensor descriptors

The public `TensorDescriptor` contract lives in
`io.github.pho001.synaptik.model.tensor`. It is an immutable record with four components:

| Component | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `dataType` | The non-null logical type of every element. |
| `shape` | The non-null ordered logical dimensions. |
| `layout` | A non-null `Optional`: present for resolved numeric geometry, empty for unresolved geometry. |
| `requiresGrad` | Whether model-level gradient eligibility is requested. This may be true only for a differentiable data type. |

Layout resolution and shape resolution are separate facts. A dynamic shape must use
`Optional.empty()` because its numeric strides and span are not known. A fully static shape may
also use `Optional.empty()` when layout has not been resolved yet; the descriptor does not invent a
contiguous default.

When a layout is present, construction rebuilds it against the paired shape through
`LayoutDescriptor.of(...)` and compares the complete value. The check covers rank, strides,
element offset, view flag, derived layout kind, and referenced element span. It proves that the
public geometry is compatible with the paired shape. It cannot prove which shape originally
created the layout because `LayoutDescriptor` deliberately does not retain source-shape identity.

`TensorDescriptor` uses record equality and hashing across all four components. Its `layout`
component follows `Optional` value semantics: inspect presence or compare values, and do not rely
on the optional container's identity. A present optional contains the exact immutable
`LayoutDescriptor` object supplied to the constructor. The generated text form is useful for
diagnostics but is not a serialization format.

### Complete descriptor example

<a id="goal-and-inputs-1"></a>
#### Goal and inputs

Create three descriptors that distinguish a fully static unresolved value, the same static value
with resolved row-major geometry, and a dynamic unresolved value. The static shape is `[2, 3]`, the
dynamic shape is `[batch, 3]`, and every value uses `FLOAT32`.

```java
import io.github.pho001.synaptik.model.datatype.DataType;
import io.github.pho001.synaptik.model.layout.LayoutDescriptor;
import io.github.pho001.synaptik.model.shape.DynamicDimension;
import io.github.pho001.synaptik.model.shape.Shape;
import io.github.pho001.synaptik.model.shape.StaticDimension;
import io.github.pho001.synaptik.model.tensor.TensorDescriptor;
import java.util.Optional;

public final class TensorDescriptorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape staticShape = Shape.of(2, 3);
        TensorDescriptor staticUnresolved = new TensorDescriptor(
                DataType.FLOAT32, staticShape, Optional.empty(), false);

        LayoutDescriptor rowMajor = LayoutDescriptor.contiguous(staticShape);
        TensorDescriptor resolved = new TensorDescriptor(
                DataType.FLOAT32, staticShape, Optional.of(rowMajor), true);

        Shape dynamicShape = Shape.ofDimensions(
                new DynamicDimension("batch"), new StaticDimension(3));
        TensorDescriptor dynamicUnresolved = new TensorDescriptor(
                DataType.FLOAT32, dynamicShape, Optional.empty(), false);

        System.out.println(staticUnresolved.layout().isEmpty());
        System.out.println(resolved.layout().orElseThrow().kind());
        System.out.println(resolved.layout().orElseThrow().referencedElementSpan());
        System.out.println(dynamicUnresolved.shape());
    }
}
```

<a id="meaningful-lines"></a>
#### Meaningful lines

- `staticUnresolved` shows that known sizes do not force a layout decision.
- `LayoutDescriptor.contiguous(staticShape)` resolves row-major strides `[3, 1]`, offset `0`, and
  referenced span `6`; `resolved` pairs that geometry with the same shape.
- `requiresGrad` is true only on `resolved`. `FLOAT32` permits that request because it is
  differentiable.
- `dynamicUnresolved` keeps the symbolic `batch` dimension and therefore has no numeric layout.

<a id="result-and-interpretation-1"></a>
#### Result and interpretation

The program prints:

```text
true
DENSE_CONTIGUOUS
6
Shape[batch, 3]
```

These results show the two layout states and the concrete geometry of the resolved `[2, 3]`
example. They do not allocate tensor storage, create a public `Tensor` or graph node, infer the
dynamic `batch` size, choose materialization, select a backend, or execute an operation.

<a id="failures-and-useful-variations-1"></a>
#### Failures and useful variations

- Supplying `Optional.of(rowMajor)` with `dynamicShape` fails with `IllegalArgumentException`
  because numeric geometry cannot be validated for an unresolved dimension.
- Requesting gradients for `INT32`, `INT64`, or `BOOL` fails with `IllegalArgumentException`.
- A present layout whose rank or reconstructed geometry differs from the paired shape fails with
  `IllegalArgumentException`; checked reconstruction overflow remains an `ArithmeticException`.
- Passing `null` for the data type, shape, or optional itself fails with `NullPointerException`.
